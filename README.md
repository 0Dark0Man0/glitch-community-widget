Glitch Widget Embed
=========================

By adding the following snippet to a project's view...

`<script src="https://widget.glitch.me/widget.min.js"></script>`

...this project's `style.css` will be added to the header, and the remix button and view source link will be appended to any element with `id="gWidget"`.

For example, this project's index view in views/index.html shows an empty footer element...

`<footer id="gWidget"></footer>`

On page load, the remix button and view source link will appear there!
